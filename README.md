### Installing from sources

It is a good practice to create a [dedicated virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) first. Even if it usually won't harm to install Python libraries directly on the system, better to contain \
dependencies in a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
